Find the «@Manybot» bot, tap on its name and start a dialogue.
In order to realize the function of automatic translation of your publications, you will be offered to create your own bot. Enter the «/addbot» command or select the «Add a new bot» option from the menu located at the bottom of a screen.
You will see the bot creation instruction in a dialogue window. You need to carry out the following actions according to this instruction:
start a dialogue with the @BotFather bot;
enter the «/newbot» command;
choose a name (use any language) and a link (in English) which should end in «bot» (for example, @autoposting_bot – we will further use this name used as an example);
receive the API token (a key) from the @BotFather bot and copy it;
go back to a dialogue with the @Manybot bot and paste a key in the message input field.
If a key input procedure is successful, you will see the message notifying that your token was accepted and a bot was created and set up. Further, you will work with the newly created bot.
Create a dialogue with the @autoposting_bot. In order to do this, tap on its name.
Send the «/autoposting» command to this bot.
You will see the menu where you can choose the translation source. The following services are available: Twitter,YouTube, VK and RSS.
After choosing a service, you will be offered to place a link to your own account in it.
Make the @autoposting_bot an administrator of a channel or a group for which auto-posting is being created.
